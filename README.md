# libSDL2

My framework based on SDL2!

Why you need this framework? WHY NOT XD, i summed up the reasons:
- I'm lazy, i don't like to do the same work again and again ;)
- Some functions need some error management.
- Others are not allowed to be used in our 1337 projects.
- Some required functions are not implemented in the standard library

Soooo I'm took a deep breath and I create my own SDL library to used like libft in my graphic projects, this library is not yet complete.
